## Leassons

- Materialize CCS is slow, big and old
- MDL (Material design lite) is superseed by Material Components for the web(https://github.com/material-components/material-components-web)
- react material (many) ?
    - MUI
    - Material UI **
    - react-toolbox (css modules) **
    - react-md
    - react-mdl (no)
- other react ui frameworks:

- React, Redux, Flux is the way to go for web pages
- vue.js as second option
- elm looks nice also
- Just need html? semantic-ui better than bootstrap
- typescript mostly not needed with ES6 + Flux
- use with create-react-app
- grunt, gulp, bower etc. should be avoided
- yarn as package manager
- use webpack or create-react-app which hides it
- Gatsby is the static geenrator which uses all the previous ones
- dont do css, sass (css) (with css-modules?)

## ToDo

- Switch to react or gatsby (remove gulp)
- Remove duplicated material fonts
